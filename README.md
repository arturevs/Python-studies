# Hi everyone, here I am updating my code development in Python.
## I study with a course at udemy developed by the teacher [**Luiz Ot√°vio Miranda**](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-do-zero-ao-avancado/).
## But, I use some other sources of information around the internet, I hope you enjoy my repository.
